This is my resume, built as a **TypeScript React Web Application** using **Tailwind CSS** and **react-icons/fa**.

I realized I can build a much more elegantly formatted resume as a web application compared to traditional tools like LibreOffice. The layout and styling were coded with assistance from Google Gemini’s free models - a deliberate choice to see how effectively a free model performs in the hands of a seasoned architect.

By releasing this publicly under the **GPLv3** license, I hope to achieve two things:
1. **Community Resource:** Provide an example for others looking for creative ways to craft their own resumes.
2. **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrate another example of my *out-of-the-box* problem-solving, and my ability to develop structured, intentional applications in a post-AI world.

A generated PDF of the application is also available in this repository if you would like to see what it looks like.
